\begin{itemize}
    \item Theme:

    The goal of this project is to simplify the way contact information and social accounts are shared with the people you meet.
    we aim to provide users with the ability to share their "Zolink", a personalized contact card web page that can be used for personal,
    business and networking purposes, without the need for their own server or domain. We hope to allow users to share complete
    contact cards with one link, QR code, or Zolink username.

\section{Background}

Nearly everyone has accounts on social media platforms such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, etc. When you meet someone it can
be a pain to share each of these accounts individually in addition to other contact information. Why not have a way to share the
information you want all at once?

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item The user-base for Zolink will include nearly any demographic, as almost anyone can make use of a digital business card. Most people have multiple social media accounts as well as email addresses, phone numbers, and a physical address. Simply put, anyone who has the ability to use the web and create an account will find Zolink useful. 
    
    All users will have the same role and capabilities on Zolink, aside from the developers who will be able to moderate user information if needed.
